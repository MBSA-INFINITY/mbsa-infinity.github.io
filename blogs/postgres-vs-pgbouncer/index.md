# Does PGBouncer Actually Help? A Measured Comparison Against Direct PostgreSQL Connections

## Summary

This article presents results from a controlled proof-of-concept comparing application traffic hitting PostgreSQL **directly** versus the same traffic routed through **PGBouncer**, a lightweight connection pooler. Two isolated PostgreSQL instances were deployed in Kubernetes/OKD — one dedicated to direct connections, one dedicated to sitting behind PGBouncer — removing any shared-resource confound between the two test paths. Two load levels were tested: a moderate load (50 concurrent clients) and an overload scenario (120 concurrent clients against a database capped at 100 connections).

The results are unambiguous: **PGBouncer improved throughput by 22-46%, cut p95/p99 tail latency by roughly a third to two-thirds, and eliminated connection-rejection errors entirely under overload** — all while using significantly fewer real database connections than the direct path.

## Test Setup

| Component | Configuration |
|---|---|
| Database | PostgreSQL 16, `max_connections=100`, `shared_buffers=256MB`, CPU limit: **1 core** per pod |
| Pooler | PGBouncer, `pool_mode=transaction`, `max_client_conn=2000` |
| Topology | Two fully isolated PostgreSQL instances — one for direct-connection traffic, one sitting behind PGBouncer — so neither path competes for the other's connection budget or CPU |
| Load generator | Custom Python tool, `persistent` connection mode (one connection held per worker for the whole run), `mixed` workload (~80% point-read `SELECT`, ~20% point-update `UPDATE` against a 100,000-row table) |
| Test duration | 180s steady-state per run, plus a ramp-up window |

Two scenarios were run:

- **Scenario A**: 50 concurrent workers, PGBouncer `default_pool_size=20` (real backend connections capped well below client demand)
- **Scenario B**: 120 concurrent workers (intentionally above Postgres's `max_connections=100`), PGBouncer `default_pool_size=50`

## Finding 1: Postgres protects itself by rejecting connections — and PGBouncer absorbs exactly what Postgres rejects

Scenario B deliberately pushed 120 concurrent workers at a Postgres instance capped at `max_connections=100`. The direct-connection test produced **exactly 20 `connect:OperationalError` failures** — precisely the excess over the connection ceiling (`120 - 100 = 20`). PostgreSQL enforces `max_connections` before allocating a backend process, so it protects itself from resource exhaustion by outright rejecting connections once the limit is hit, rather than degrading gracefully.

In our load generator, a connection failure at startup is fatal for that worker — it never retries and permanently drops out of the test. So this isn't a transient blip: the direct-connection test effectively ran the rest of its 180 seconds with only ~100 active workers instead of 120, silently losing 17% of its intended concurrency.

The PGBouncer-fronted test, hitting the exact same overload of 120 concurrent clients, recorded **zero errors**. PGBouncer's client-facing connection ceiling (`max_client_conn=2000`) absorbed all 120 client sockets, and its transaction-pooling queued the excess demand against a real backend pool of just 50 connections — well inside Postgres's 100-connection budget. No client was ever rejected; excess demand simply waited briefly in PGBouncer's queue instead of being turned away by the database.

This is the core operational argument for connection pooling: **it converts a hard failure mode (client-visible connection errors) into a soft one (slightly higher queueing latency).**

## Finding 2: PGBouncer wins on raw throughput too — even below the connection limit

Scenario A ran well under Postgres's connection ceiling (50 clients vs. a 100-connection limit), so there was no error/rejection story to tell — and PGBouncer still delivered **46% higher throughput** and roughly **half the tail latency**. This is not about avoiding failure; it's about efficiency.

Both Postgres pods in this test were capped at **1 CPU core**. Postgres is process-per-connection: each concurrently active backend competes for CPU time, and several of Postgres's internal bookkeeping structures (MVCC snapshot computation over the process array, lightweight-lock contention on shared buffers) scale with the *number of concurrently active backends*, not the amount of useful work being done. Running 50 truly concurrent backends on a single core means constant context-switching and lock contention. PGBouncer, by holding real backend concurrency to 20 and queueing the rest, keeps active concurrency closer to a level that single core can actually execute efficiently — so more transactions complete per second even though fewer are ever "in flight" against the database at once.

## Finding 3: Fewer real connections did more work — a 3.7x efficiency gain

Normalizing throughput by the number of real Postgres connections used tells a clean story about resource efficiency:

| Scenario | Path | Successful tx | Real backend connections used | Tx per real connection |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| A (50 conc.) | Direct | 1,212,701 | 50 | ~24,254 |
| A (50 conc.) | Via PGBouncer | 1,779,461 | ≤20 | **~88,973** |
| B (120 conc.) | Direct | 1,164,356 | ~100 (20 rejected) | ~11,644 |
| B (120 conc.) | Via PGBouncer | 1,418,183 | ≤50 | **~28,364** |

In both scenarios, PGBouncer extracted **2.4x to 3.7x more useful work per real database connection** than the direct path — a meaningful number if database connections are a constrained/expensive resource (which, given Postgres's per-connection memory footprint, they generally are).

## Finding 4: Connection-establishment cost is dramatically and consistently lower through PGBouncer

Across both scenarios, mean connection-establishment latency was **49-60% lower** via PGBouncer:

| Scenario | Direct (mean connect) | Via PGBouncer (mean connect) | Reduction |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| A (50 concurrency) | 16.15 ms | 8.23 ms | 49% |
| B (120 concurrency) | 32.34 ms | 12.86 ms | 60% |

Direct connections require Postgres to `fork()` a new OS process, initialize its memory context, and complete authentication for every new connection — real, non-trivial work that gets more expensive as more of it happens simultaneously (as seen in the ramp-up windows of every run). PGBouncer's client-facing accept is comparatively free (a TCP handshake plus an in-process credential check), and its own real backend connections to Postgres are opened lazily, on demand, as transactions actually arrive — spreading that expensive work over time instead of forcing it into a synchronized burst. This gap grew larger under heavier concurrency (120 vs. 50), exactly when connection-storm behavior matters most.

## Finding 5: The one place PGBouncer looked worse — p50 latency under overload

In Scenario B, PGBouncer's p50 latency (7.26ms) was actually *higher* than direct's (5.12ms). This is the visible cost of admission control: with 120 clients sharing only 50 real backend connections, a typical transaction now spends part of its time queued in PGBouncer waiting for one to free up. Direct connections never queue at this concurrency (each of the ~100 that succeeded gets its own dedicated backend), so their median transaction runs immediately — right up until the point where the *next* client can't get a connection at all and fails outright. This is the fundamental trade PGBouncer makes: a small, bounded, and configurable amount of queueing latency, in exchange for **never hard-rejecting a client**.

## Practical Takeaways

1. **PGBouncer is not just an overload safety net — it improved throughput even under normal, non-overloaded conditions**, by keeping real database concurrency closer to what the underlying hardware can execute efficiently.
2. **Under overload, PGBouncer converts hard connection failures into soft queueing delay.** In this test, the exact number of direct-connection failures matched the exact overshoot past `max_connections` — a clean, reproducible demonstration of Postgres's own admission-control behavior, and of what a pooler protects against.
3. **Pool size is a genuine tuning knob, not a "bigger is safer" setting.** A pool of 20 outperformed a pool of 50 on raw throughput in this hardware-constrained (1 CPU core) setup — right-sizing the pool to the database's actual execution capacity mattered more than maximizing it.
4. **Connection-establishment cost reduction alone is a strong, independent argument for pooling** — separate from the throughput/latency story — and it compounds under connection-storm-style load (deploys, autoscaling events, serverless cold starts).

## Methodology Notes and Caveats

- Both PostgreSQL instances (direct-path and PGBouncer-path) were deployed as fully separate pods/services with identical configuration and resource limits, specifically to eliminate the shared-connection-budget confound that skewed an earlier iteration of this test (where a single shared Postgres instance made PGBouncer look artificially slower, since its own pooled connections were silently competing with the direct test for the same `max_connections` budget).
- Because the two Postgres instances are separate pods, some residual variance (e.g., differing node placement or storage backend) cannot be fully ruled out without explicit node-affinity pinning — a caveat worth disclosing in any write-up of these numbers.
- All figures above are taken directly from the load generator's `RESULT_JSON` output for each run; percentiles are computed over the full set of successful transaction latencies per run.
